# FootballAnalytics
This project uses YOLOv8 and Python to perform real-time object detection and tracking of football players and the ball from match footage. The system is trained on annotated datasets via Roboflow, and integrates NumPy and custom logic to analyze player movement, ball possession, and gameplay intensity.
